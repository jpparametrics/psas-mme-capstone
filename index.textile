title: Rocket Manufacturing
---

Portland State Aerospace Society worked with a Mechanical and Materials Engineering capstone team to develop a prototype of the next generation carbon fiber Launch Vehicle 3. The team was fantastic and delivered us not only a modular rocket but also the fully documented manufacturing process, the layup mandrels, a curing oven, and a layup table. 

The term ends the second week of June 2014 so check back for final deliverables, including rocket requirements, CAD files for all rocket parts, and instruction manuals for the manufacturing process.
